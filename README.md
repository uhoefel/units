# Units

Units is a [Java](https://openjdk.java.net/) library designed to handle units and constants.
It is designed to handle string based units as well as sharper defined units.
Some of the supported features include:
- conversions of values, e.g.:
  ```java
  Units.convert(3, "m", "mm");
  Units.convert(3, SiBaseUnit.METER, "mm");
  ```
  would both return `3000`.
- simplification of string based units, e.g.:
  ```java
  Units.simplify("TODO");
  ```
  would return `"N Wb"`.
  As the simplification is an expensive operation, the results are cached internally.
- finding the names of a unit in a specific context, e.g.:
  ```java
  Units.inContext("TODO", UnitContextMatch.COMPATIBLE, PhysicsContext.THERMODYNAMICS);
  ```
  would return TODO
- supports [SI units](https://www.bipm.org/en/publications/si-brochure/), binary units, [imperial units](https://www.legislation.gov.uk/ukpga/1985/72), [US customary units](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States_customary_units), [atomic units](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hartree_atomic_units), [planck units](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Planck_units) and many more. The user can also easily define own units.
- supports SI prefixes, binary prefixes and allows the user to easily implement own prefixes
- Can handle unknown units if not relevant, e.g.:
  ```java
  Units.convert(3, "m^2 this_is_not_a_unit", "mm^2 this_is_not_a_unit");
  ```
  would return `3e6`, as the unknown unit `this_is_not_a_unit` is the same on both sides of the conversion.
- for performance critical parts of the code one can obtain the conversion factor (if the conversion is purely multiplicative), e.g.:
  ```java
  Units.factor("kg", "t");
  ```
  will return `1e-3`.
- Allows to check for equivalence, e.g.
  ```java
  Units.equivalent("s", "min");
  ```
  will return false, as `1min` is not the same as `1s`. On the other hand, checking for convertibility
  ```java
  Units.convertible("s", "min");
  ```
  will return `true`.

The constants are implemented via a `ScientificConstant` interface that supports e.g.:
- definition of own constants, e.g.
  ```java
  // (3 Â± 0.2) mole
  ScientificConstant.of(3, 0.2, "mole");
  ```
- chaining commands, e.g.
  ```java
  // constant with the distance travelled by light in vacuum in 2 seconds as value
  PhysicsConstant.SPEED_OF_LIGHT_IN_VACUUM.mul(2, "s");

  // constant of the elementary charge per (electron) mass
  PhysicsConstant.ELEMENTARY_CHARGE.div(PhysicsConstant.ELECTRON_MASS);

  ScientificConstant c = ScientificConstant.of(3, 0.2, "mole");
  PhysicsConstant.SHIELDING_DIFFERENCE_OF_T_AND_P_IN_HT.mul(c);
  ```
- (simple) uncertainty propagation
- the `ScientificConstant` interface provides default implementations for the `Texable` interface from the `eu.hoefel.jatex` module, such that a constant can easily return proper LaTeX code.
- properly documented implementations for most of the physics constants as defined by NIST, as well as some mathematical constants.

Installation
============

The artifact can be found at maven central:
```xml
